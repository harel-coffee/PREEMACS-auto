MRIQC provides a series of image processing workflows
to extract and compute a series of NR (no-reference), IQMs
(image quality metrics) to be used in QAPs (quality
assessment protocols) for MRI (magnetic
resonance imaging). This open-source neuroimaging data
processing tool is being developed as a part of the MRI
image analysis and reproducibility platform offered by the
CRN. This pipeline derives from, and is heavily influenced
by, the PCP Quality Assessment Protocol. This tool extracts
a series of IQMs from structural and functional MRI data.
It is also scheduled to add diffusion MRI to the target
imaging families.
